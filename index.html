                        <p class="fs-20 r_r">Many people find that they become angry, irritable, irritable or even give a shit to their surroundings when they are under pressure. It affects themselves and others, it must be taken seriously! Do you know one or more such people or are you yourself such a person? Here you will learn how and why you created such a reaction, if you have that behavior or if you associate with someone who has that behavior, you will also learn how you can help yourself in this situation.</p>

                        <p class="fs-20 r_r">Many of the situations you and I experience in everyday life are learning processes for personal development, but this time it can happen via your self-awareness to become aware of the blockages to see the clarity or the light if you will. This time you design your mindset via your self-awareness by knowing what triggers or blocks you. Take charge, put yourself in the driver's seat and create clarity with HOW & WHY.</p>

                        <p class="fs-20 r_r">Cosmos New Age Energy is a new form of learning where you work with your outer and inner via visual thinking strategy to create balance in your inner and outer world. You can't change anything inside or outside if you don't know why it was created! Deal with the negative energies that create problems and challenges in your everyday life, they are there so that you can learn something about yourself! Problems and challenges are there because you need to learn from them, otherwise if they weren't there you would have dealt with them! Cosmos is Yin and Yang. Do you want balance and quality of life on a personal level / job / family / society or something else? Learn about creation, then conflicts and challenges become easier to dissolve through conflict revolution. You will train new communication skills by becoming aware of your learning from the negative experiences in everyday life for greater self-awareness, thereby improving the handling of your challenges, in one and the same workflow!</p>
                        <p class="fs-20 r_r">I have spent 16 years analyzing the mindset which is the mind and these are the same words, feelings and emotions we all use when we think, speak and make choices and decisions. I also call it communication skills! </p>
                        <p class="fs-20 r_r">The energy is the value for the strategy, what kind of energy do you draw on? Positive or negative?</p>
